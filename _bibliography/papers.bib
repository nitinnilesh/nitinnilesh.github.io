  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Air pollution is a concern to the health of all living beings. It is essential to check on the quality of air in the surroundings. This article presents an IoT-based real-time air quality index (AQI) estimation technique using images and weather sensors on Indian roads. A mixture of image features, i.e., traffic density, visibility, and sensor features, i.e., temperature and humidity, were used to predict the AQI. Object detection and localization-based Deep Learning (DL) method along with image processing techniques were used to extract image features while an Machine Learning (ML) model was trained on those features to estimate the AQI. In order to conduct this experiment, a dataset containing 5048 images along with co-located AQI values across different seasons was collected by driving on the roads of Hyderabad city in India. The experimental results report an overall accuracy of 82% for AQI prediction.},
