  abstract={A system and method for implementing an experiment remotely and determining an output using a computer-vision model is provided. The system includes an image capturing device, an experiment setup, a microcontroller, a user device, and a relay unit. The microcontroller (i) receives the input of the experiment from the image capturing device, (ii) extracts one or more frames from the input data, (iii) pre-process the one or more frames to obtain a binary image, (iv) obtain a closed curve around the binary image to locate the experiment, (v) determine the coordinates of the experiment to track the experiment in each frame, (vi) determine an output of the experiment from every two consecutive frames of the one or more frames, and (vii) optimize the determined output of the experiment using a linear regression model.},
