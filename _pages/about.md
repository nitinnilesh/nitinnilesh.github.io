ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I am Nitin Nilesh, currently employed as a **Camera Modeling Engineer** at **[Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/research)**, where my primary focus is on the development and enhancement of Image Signal Processor pipelines. My educational background includes a **[Master of Science by Research degree](https://www.iiit.ac.in/academics/postgraduate/ms/cse/)** from the **International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT Hyderabad)**. During my time at IIIT Hyderabad, I conducted research at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and IoT, under the guidance of **Prof. [Sachin Chaudhari](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/)** and **Prof. [C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/)**.

Prior to my role at Qualcomm, I had the privilege of interning with the **[Amazon India Machine Learning team](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/machine-learning)**. During this internship, I had the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional individuals and worked on projects involving [Graph Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network).

My research interests encompass various domains, including Computer Vision, [Computational Photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography), Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Aside from my research endeavors, I have a passion for education and mentoring. I actively served as a mentor at **[TalentSprint](https://talentsprint.com)**, where I contributed to the [AI/ML foundations course](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad) offered in collaboration between IIIT Hyderabad and Talent Sprint. In this role, I delivered lectures on fundamental concepts in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to industry professionals, guiding them through their project work.

Apart from this, I am an enthusiast of sports, particularly **Badminton** and **[Chess](https://lichess.org/@/dead_knight)**. Additionally, I enjoy engaging in cycling and running as part of my recreational pursuits.
