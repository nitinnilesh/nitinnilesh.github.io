ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I am Nitin Nilesh, currently employed as the **Generative AI Lead** at [Harman](https://services.harman.com/services/generativeai), where I collaborate with **[IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com)** to develop [healthcare solutions](https://www.iqvia.com/solutions/technologies/orchestrated-clinical-trials/patient-engagement-suite/ecoa). My educational background includes a **[Master of Science by Research degree](https://www.iiit.ac.in/academics/postgraduate/ms/cse/)** from the **International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT Hyderabad)**. During my time at IIIT Hyderabad, I conducted research at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and IoT, under the guidance of **Prof. [Sachin Chaudhari](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/)** and **Prof. [C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/)**.

Before joining Harman, I worked as a **Camera Modeling Engineer** at **[Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/research)**, where I focused on developing and enhancing [Image Signal Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processor) pipelines. Prior to that, I interned with the **[Amazon India Machine Learning team](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/machine-learning)**, collaborating with exceptional individuals on projects involving [Graph Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network).

#### Research
My research interests encompass various domains, including Computer Vision, [Computational Photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography), Generative AI, Environmental Sensing (Air Pollution Monitoring), Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

#### Teaching
In addition to my research pursuits, I am passionate about education and mentoring. I actively mentor at **[TalentSprint](https://talentsprint.com)**, where I contribute to the [AI and MLOps Programme](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-mlops-iisc-bangalore) in collaboration with [IISc Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in) and TalentSprint, as well as the [AI/ML Programme](https://talentsprint.com/course/ai-machine-learning-iiit-hyderabad) in collaboration with IIIT Hyderabad and TalentSprint. In this role, I deliver lectures on fundamental concepts in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to industry professionals, guiding them through their project work.

Apart from this, I am an enthusiast of sports, particularly **Badminton** and **[Chess](https://lichess.org/@/dead_knight)**. Additionally, I enjoy engaging in cycling and running as part of my recreational pursuits.
